# Sheet Music Search Engine

(in progress...)

A new search engine for IMSLP music library. The original website [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Main_Page) uses direct Google Search engine which is sometimes not user-friendly. This project should provide an alternative where you can easily search through their database and have a quick access to the recordings and sheet music.
